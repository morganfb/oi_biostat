This module contains labs 4A,4B,5 & 6 adapted for StatsTeachR from OpenIntro.

Lab 4A Foundations for statistical inference - Sampling distributions:
	This module contains a lab assignment that introduces students to the sampling distribution and how it depends on the sample size. It also introduces for loops and how to run a simple simulation. The data used for this lab is from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, GA, and analysis focuses on variables such as weight and desired weight of individuals living in the US.

Lab 4B Foundations for statistical inference - Confidence Levels:
	This module contains a lab assignment that introduces students to confidence intervals, confidence levels and critical values. The data used in this lab is the same as in lab 4A from the CDC, and analysis focuses on variables such as height and weight of individuals living in the US.

Lab 5 Inference for numerical data:
	This module contains a lab assignment that introduces the concept of inference (using both confidence intervals and hypothesis testing) for numeric data. The data set used in this lab contains information on births recorded in North Carolina in 2004.

Lab 6 Inference for categorical data:
	This lab assignment applies concepts and data from the previous lab 5 to categorical data.
