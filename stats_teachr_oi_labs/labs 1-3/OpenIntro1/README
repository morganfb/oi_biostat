This module contains the first 3 lab assignments adapted for StatsTeachR from OpenIntro. 

Lab 1 Introduction to Data:
	This lab can be used to teach an introduction to data. It walks students through introductory R commands needed to explore data (e.g. different ways to subset data).The data in this lab describes diabetic hospital encounters provided on behalf of the Center for Clinical and Translational Research at the Virginia Commonwealth University.

Lab 2 Probability:
	This lab teaches students how to simulate data and question if data is independently distributed. The data used in this lab is from OpenIntro and contains statistics on Kobe Bryant. Specifically students are looking at how many baskets in a row Kobe Bryant makes and determining whether his shots are independent or not.

Lab 3 Introduction to Random Variables:
	This lab can be used to teach students how to assess if data is normally distributed or not. The lab assignment explores what a normal distribution looks like, and provides a few R commands that are useful in determining if your data is normal. The data in this lab is from the Cleveland Clinic Foundation and is concerned with heart disease diagnosis.

Solutions are provided for “On Your Own” questions for all labs.
