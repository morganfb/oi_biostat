\eoce{\qt{Migraine and acupuncture\label{migraine_and_acupuncture_intro}} Acupuncture is sometimes recommended as a treatment option for migraines; a migraine is a particularly painful type of headache. To determine whether acupuncture relieves migraine 
pain, researchers conducted a randomized controlled study in which 89 females 
diagnosed with migraines were randomly assigned to one of two groups: 
treatment or control. The 43 patients in the treatment group received acupuncture 
that is specifically designed to treat migraines, while 46 patients in the control 
group received placebo acupuncture (needle insertion at a non-acupoint 
locations). 24 hours after receiving acupuncture, patients were asked 
if they were pain free; the results are summarized in the contingency table below.

\eoce{\qt{Sinusitis and antibiotics\label{sinusitis_and_antibiotics_intro}} 
Researchers studying the effect of antibiotic treatment for acute sinusitis randomly assigned 166 adults diagnosed with acute sinusitis to either the treatment or control groups. Patients in the treatment group received a 10-day course of amoxicillin, while patients in the control group received a placebo consisting of symptomatic treatments, such as nasal decongestants. At the end of the 10-day period, patients were asked if they experienced significant improvement in their symptoms. The distribution of responses are summarized below.

\item Among the smokers, what proportion have aortic stenosis? This number is a component of the conditional distribution fo stenosis for the two categories of smokers. What proportion of non-smokers have aortic stenosis?
\item In this context, relative risk is the ratio of the proportion of smokers with stenosis to the proportion of non-smokers with stenosis. Relative risks greater than 1 indicate that smokers are at a higher risk for aortic stenosis than non-smokers; relative risks of 1.2 or higher are generally considered cause for alarm. Calculate the relative risk for the 215 participants, comparing smokers to non-smokers. Does there seem to be evidence that smoking is associated with an increased probability of stenosis?

\eoce{\qt{Air pollution and birth outcomes, study components\label{study_components_airpoll}} 
Researchers collected data to examine the relationship between air pollutants 
and preterm births in Southern California. During the study, air pollution levels 
were measured by air quality monitoring stations. Specifically, levels of carbon 
monoxide were recorded in parts per million, nitrogen dioxide and ozone in parts 
per hundred million, and coarse particulate matter (PM$_{10}$) in $\mu g/m^3$. 
Length of gestation data were collected for 143,196 births between the years 1989 
and 1993, and air pollution exposure during gestation was calculated for each 
birth. The analysis suggested that increased ambient PM$_{10}$ and, to a lesser 
degree, CO concentrations may be associated with the occurrence of preterm births.

\eoce{\qt{Buteyko method, study components\label{study_components_buteyko}} 
The Buteyko method is a shallow breathing technique developed by Konstantin 
Buteyko, a Russian doctor, in 1952. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the Buteyko 
method can reduce asthma symptoms and improve quality of life. In a scientific 
study to determine the effectiveness of this method, researchers recruited 600 
asthma patients aged 18-69 who relied on medication for asthma treatment. These 
patients were split into two research groups: one practiced the Buteyko method 
and the other did not. Afterwards, patients were scored on quality of life, activity, 
asthma symptoms, and medication reduction on a scale from 0 to 10. On average, 
the participants in the Buteyko group experienced a significant reduction in 
asthma symptoms and an improvement in quality of life. \footfullcite{McDowan:2003}

\eoce{\qt{Hummingbird taste behavior, study components\label{study_components_hummingbirds}}
Researchers hypothesized that a particular taste receptor in hummingbirds, T1R1-T1R3, played a primary role in dictating taste behavior; specifically, in determining which compounds hummingbirds detect as sweet. In a series of field tests, hummingbirds were presented simultaneously with two filled containers, one containing test stimuli and a second containing sucrose. The test stimuli included aspartame, erythritol, water, and sucrose. Aspartame is an artificial sweetener that tastes sweet to humans, but is not detected by hummingbird T1R1-T1R3 , while erythritol is an artificial sweetener known to activate T1R1-T1R3.

Data were collected on how long a hummingbird drank from a particular container for a given trial, measured in seconds. For example, in one field test comparing aspartame and sucrose, a hummingbird drank from the aspartame container for 0.54 seconds and from the sucrose container for 3.21 seconds.

\eoce{\qt{Egg coloration\label{egg_coloration}}
The evolutionary significance of variation in egg coloration among birds is not fully understood. One hypothesis suggests that egg coloration may be an indication of female quality, with healthier females being capable of depositing blue-green pigment into eggshells instead of using it for themselves as an antioxidant. In a study conducted on 32 collared flycatchers, half of the females were given supplementary diets before and during egg laying. Eggs were measured for darkness of blue color using spectrophotometry; for example, the mean amount of blue-green chroma was 0.594 absorbance units. Egg mass was also recorded.

\eoce{\qt{Cheaters, study components\label{study_components_cheaters}} 
Researchers studying the relationship between honesty, age and 
self-control conducted an experiment on 160 children between the ages of 5 and 
15. Participants reported their age, sex, and whether they were an only child 
or not. The researchers asked each child to toss a fair coin in private and 
to record the outcome (white or black) on a paper sheet, and said they 
would only reward children who report white. Half the students were explicitly 
told not to cheat and the others were not given any explicit instructions. In 
the no instruction group probability of cheating was found to be uniform 
across groups based on child's characteristics. In the group that was 
explicitly told to not cheat, girls were less likely to cheat, and while rate 
of cheating didn't vary by age for boys, it decreased with age for girls.

to identify themselves as having low or high social-class by comparing 
themselves to others with the most (least) money, most (least) education, and 
most (least) respected jobs. They were also presented  with a jar of 
individually wrapped candies and informed that the candies were for children
in a nearby laboratory, but that they could take some if they wanted. After 
completing some unrelated tasks, participants reported the number of candies 
they had taken. It was found that those who were identified as upper-class 
took more candy than others. \footfullcite{Piff:2012} Identify

\begin{adjustwidth}{1em}{1em}
{\footnotesize ``Researchers analyzed data from 23,123 health plan members who 
participated in a voluntary exam and health behavior survey from 1978 to 1985, 
when they were 50-60 years old. 23 years later, about 25\% of the group had 
dementia, including 1,136 with Alzheimer's disease and 416 with vascular 
dementia. After adjusting for other factors, the researchers concluded that 
pack-a-day smokers were 37\% more likely than nonsmokers to develop dementia, 
and the risks went up with increased smoking; 44\% for one to two packs a day; 
and twice the risk for more than two packs."}

The American Journal of Preventive Medicine 50: e73-e80.} After a tax increase from 6\% to 9\% in 2011, the statewide gonorrhea rate declined by 24\%, the equivalent of 1,600 cases per year. In a statement to the \textit{New York Times}, the lead author of the paper was quoted saying, "Policy makers should consider raising liquor taxes if they're looking for ways to prevent sexually transmitted infections. In the year and a half following the alcohol tax rise in Maryland, this prevented 2,400 cases of gonorrhea and saved half a million dollars in health care costs." In no more than three sentences, explain whether you think the lead author's statement is accurate.

\eoce{\qt{Air quality\label{air_quality_durham}} Daily air quality is measured by the air 
quality index (AQI) reported by the Environmental Protection Agency. This index reports 
the pollution level and what associated health effects might be a concern. The index is 
calculated for five major air pollutants regulated by the Clean Air Act and takes values 
from 0 to 300, where a higher value indicates lower air quality. AQI was reported for a 
sample of 91 days in 2011 in Durham, NC. The relative frequency histogram below shows 
the distribution of the AQI values on these days. \footfullcite{data:durhamAQI:2011}

\eoce{\qt{Nursing home residents\label{nursing_homes}}
Since states with larger numbers of elderly residents would naturally have more nursing home residents, the number of nursing home residents in a state is often adjusted for the number of people 65 years of age or order (65+). That adjustment is usually given as the number of nursing home residents age 65+ per 1,000 members of the population age 65+. For example, a hypothetical state with 200 nursing home residents age 65+ and 50,000 people age 65+ would have the same adjusted number of residents as a state with 400 residents and a total age 65+ population of 100,000 residents: 4 residents per 1,000. 

Compare the two plots below, which both show the distribution of the number of nursing home residents per 1,000 members of the population 65+ (in each state).

\eoce{\qt{Eating disorders\label{korean_survey}}
In a 2003 survey examining weights and body image concerns among young Korean women, researchers administered a questionnaire to 264 female college students in Seoul, South Korea. The survey was designed to assess excessive concern with weight and dieting, consisting of questions such as "If I gain a pound, I worry that I will keep gaining." Questionnaires were given numerical scores on the Drive for Thinness Scale. Roughly speaking, a score of 15 is typical of Western women with eating disorders, but unusually high (90$^{th}$) percentile for other Western women.

\eoce{\qt{Anger and cardiovascular health\label{anger_chd}}
Trait anger is defined as a relatively stable personality trait that is manifested in the frequency, intensity, and duration of feelings associated with anger. People with high trait anger have rage and fury more often, more intensely, and with long-laster episodes than people with low trait anger. It is thought that people with high trait anger might be particularly susceptible to coronary heart disease; 12,986 participants were recruited for a study examining this hypothesis. Participants were followed for five years. The following table shows data for the participants identified as having normal blood pressure (normotensives).
